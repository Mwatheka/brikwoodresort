            <h2>Nairobi City </h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
              <b>Nairobi</b> has become synonym with safaris and wild animals because of its close proximity to some of the biggest nature parks in East Africa. But Kenya’s capital is also a metropolitan, busy city with plenty of things to do, places to discover, and attractions worth a visit. The city has become a great culinary destination as well, with markets and restaurants ready to keep you busy (and very well-fed) before you head off into the wilderness. The heart of cosmopolitan Nairobi, the Central Business District (CBD) is filled with all manner of things to see and do, day or night. The plus in staying in the <b>Nairobi</b> is, of course, the action and vibrancy, but the glaringly obvious minus is the feeling of being locked in a concrete jungle when you could be out with nature. The hustle and bustle may be exciting and distracting, but you are advised to be on your guard here as petty crime is rampant. If you’ve got nowhere to be and no plans to occupy you, the <b>Nairobi</b> is the best area for meandering around. We must warn you however not to talk on the phone while crossing the road, as this is strictly verboten. The downtown area has some of the best bars and <b>restaurants in Nairobi</b>. Try Nyama Choma, which is Swahili for barbecue. You will find all of the classic meats, as well as farm-raised ostrich and crocodile. Nairobi City Market is the best place in town shopping. Another must-see is the Nairobi Maasai Market, located between the CBD and the Westlands. Haggling is a hot-button issue here: it is encouraged, and one could even say required, but too much of it can quickly turn insulting. The Maasai take pride in their craft and don’t want to give it to you at any cost. Be reasonable but respectful. Head up to the Kenyatta Convention Center helipad for the best and vastest views of the city. Have a cocktail at Lord Delamere Terrace & Bar, est. 1904, and think about the fact that a little over four miles away there are lions, giraffes, elephants, and rhinos roaming around. The perhaps most important thing to keep in mind when visiting Nairobi is not to let worry cloud your fun. The Kenyan capital is an endlessly entertaining and welcoming place to find yourself any time. The contrast Nairobi offers in the wild and untouched landscape spreading eternally from it, interrupted in its arid, flat way only by the skyscrapers and noise of a metropolis, is something you won’t soon forget.
